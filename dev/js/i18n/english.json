    "wyn.p01": "There are different kinds of Wiis. For this guide you need a PAL Wii.<br/><a href=&quot;wiki/wii-models/&quot;>Learn more</a>",
    "wyn.p02": "You must have a Wii Remote. Later in the guide we'll show you how you can use Priiloader to almost never need a Wii Remote again.",
    "wyn.p03": "Don't forget this one: Without a Sensor Bar you can't navigate the Wii System Menu.",
    "wyn.p04": "Minimum size: 1GB. There is no exact upper limit but since the Wii has issues with SDXC, we highly recommend to stick to SDHC and 32GB at most. Adapters do work.<br/><a href=&quot;http://www.wiibrew.org/wiki/SD/SDHC_Card_Compatibility_Tests&quot;>Compatibility list</a>",
    "wyn.p05": "Minimum size: 8GB. Every type (USB 1, 2 or 3) is supported but USB 2 is optimal since it's a lot faster than 1 and the Wii doesn't have USB 3 ports so you won't benefit from extra speed. 8GB USB 2's sometimes go for only a few bucks or sometimes even advertisement gifts.",
    "wyn.p06": "Same thing as with the USB Sticks (click USB Stick icon for the info) but for HDD's we recommend a max. 'physical size' of 2TB since making partitions beyond that becomes more complicated (but not impossible).",
    "wyn.p07": "While any TV that works with your Wii also works with this guide (Yes, no matter if PAL or NTSC) we do recommend a CRT over a flatscreen / LCD TV because CRTs are typically faster in response time which makes for a more competitive and snappy experience. Some bad flatscreens can have display lag that is worse than Netplay.",
    "wyn.p08": "Thanks to the cross-platform tools we have in this guide it doesn't matter if you're using Windows, Mac OS or Linux! Any tower PC / Desktop, Laptop or Netbook works. You only need internet and a USB port for your USB device.",
    "wyn.p09": "If you don't have an internal SD Card reader you'll need an external one, typicall as a USB device. You can get these for a few bucks off of ebay but it might be easier for you to ask someone to use their computer if you don't have a reader.",
    "wyn.p10": "Your typical built-in SD Card reader. Most Desktop PCs and Notebooks have this.",
    "wyn.p11": "This is a special download package made exclusively for this guide. It saves you the hassle of having to download all the small things individually. Includes: Project M 3.6-mf, USB Loader GX, wbfs_file_2.9, Priiloader, d2x-cIOS Installer<br/><a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/&quot;>Download (coming soon)</a>",
    "wyn.p12": "Since Project M is built on top of NTSC Brawl you need an ISO file of it. A PAL Brawl ISO file does not work.<br/><a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/&quot;>How to obtain (coming soon)</a>",
