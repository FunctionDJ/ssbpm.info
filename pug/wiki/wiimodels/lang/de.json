  "1.old": "\"***Project M*** is a [gameplay modification](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Gameplay_modification) of [*Super Smash Bros. Brawl*](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl) designed to make the gameplay more closely resemble that of [*Super Smash Bros. Melee*](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee), as well as [*Super Smash Bros.*](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Super_Smash_Bros.) to a lesser extent. *Project M's* primary change from *Brawl* is that the speed of gameplay has been generally increased and the character landing lag is shorter, alonside the restoration of *Melee* mechanics and elements, such as the addition of [Mewtwo](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Mewtwo_(PM)) and [Roy](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Roy_(PM)) after their absence in *Brawl*. *Project M's* development team was partly descended from the original developers for [*Brawl+*](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Brawl%2B), later known as the **PMDT** or **Project M Dev Team** (formerly the **PMBR** or **Project M Backroom**), having members from over ten countries. Development of the mod officially concluded on December 1st, 2015, with version 3.6 being the last official release of *Project M*.",
  "1": "\"***Project M*** ist eine [Spiel-Modifikation](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Gameplay_modification) von [*Super Smash Bros. Brawl*](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl), welche entwickelt wurde, um das Gameplay mehr dem von [*Super Smash Bros. Melee*]() und zu einem gewissen Grad auch [*Super Smash Bros.*]() zu ähneln. *Project M's* wichtigste Veränderung von *Brawl* ist generall die Verschnellerung des Gameplays und die Reduktion des Landing Lags der Charaktere, weiterhin wurden *Melee* Mechaniken und Elements wiederhergestellt, wie die Wieder-Einführung von [Mewtwo](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Mewtwo_(PM)) und [Roy](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Roy_(PM)) nach ihrem Fehlen in *Brawl*. *Project M's* Entwicklerteam bestand teilweise aus den ursprünglichen Entwicklern für [*Brawl+*](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Brawl%2B), später bekannt als das **PMDT** oder **Project M Dev Team** (früher der **PMBR** oder **Project M Backroom**), mit Mitgliedern aus über zehn Ländern.

  "2": "*Project M* has been commonly featured at several [national](https://www.ssbwiki.com/National_tournament) [tournaments](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Tournament), such as the Zenith series, [The Big House series](https://www.ssbwiki.com/The_Big_House_(tournament_series)), and [Apex 2014](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Apex_2014), and it remains the most popular gameplay mod of *Brawl* in tournament settings. Starting in 2013, *Project M* saw a rapid rise in its popularity as more characters became playable and the mod became more familiar at Smash tournaments. By 2014, it began to develop its tournament scene, with the number entrants for Apex 2014's *PM* singles event notably surpassing the number of competitors for *Brawl*. Despite the end of *Project M's* official development, it still has been able to maintain its tournament presence seperate from *Brawl*, including the formation of its Backroom, the New PMBR, on July 21, 2016.",
  "3": "*Project M* only supports [NTSC](https://www.ssbwiki.com/NTSC) versions of *Brawl*, and no [PAL](https://www.ssbwiki.com/PAL) build was ever released. As a result, running *Project M* outside of NTSC regions requires homebrew as to allow the Wii to run an NTSC version of the game.\"",
