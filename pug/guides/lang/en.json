      "Another drawback of this method is that you always need a Wii Remote and therefore a sensor bar and batteries or battery pack for that Remote in order to launch Super Smash Bros. Brawl.",
      "Finally this method only allows Brawl mods up to 2GB in size since Brawl itself doesn't read any bigger SD Cards.",

      "This allows you to install Priiloader so you almost never need a Wii Remote again and can do most things with a GameCube controller.",
      "A furhter advantage over the hackless method is that you can use mods that are more than 2GB in size like Legacy XP and such, and you don't need to remove all stage builder stages.",
      "This method launches the Project M (or whatever mod) launcher from the Homebrew Channel to directly inject the files and changes while launching Brawl, so you instantly start the mod."
